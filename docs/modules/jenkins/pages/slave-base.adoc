= ODS Jenkins Slave base

We have a base image for different jenkins slaves.
The concrete slave images are then configured as part of the quickstarters.
The base image contains the following customizations

* SonarQube Scanner
* SonarQube CNES Report Plugin
* https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor]
* Skopeo
* https://snyk.io[Snyk] - used to scan and monitor projects vulnerable third-party dependencies
* Setting of Enterprise Proxy

When the container image is built, it fetches automatically the OpenShift root CA certificate and stores it, so that the `oc`-cli tool
can pick it up later and also adds the base domain wildcard certificate to the Java certificate store.

The setting of the enterprise proxy takes care that Jenkins slave works also on OpenShift clusters in enterprises that use a web proxy.
